I don't know who created this meme. But it has been circulating in a badly compressed picture.

*The question remains - Is this text a lossy or lossless conservation of that meme?*

**Types of introvert friends:**
- The sidekick. Makes one friend, hopes they have other
friends and that these other friends are similar enough to
accept them.
- The roomba. Is just sort of always there, awkward and
adorable, so that it's weird when they leave.
- The rockstar. Appears with glitter and alcohol and
disappears just as fast, because they have the energy for
7.42 minutes of social interaction today and want it to be
memorable.
- The union man. Only feels comfortable socializing if they can
do something for you. Has a lot of strange but useful skills,
equally likely to help you tile your bathroom as hide a body.
- The potential Al. Far more comfortable in text than in person.
Runs the group discord, perpetually active, rarely if ever seen
in reality.
- The summon. Capable of socializing for hours if need be, but
feels really weird about being in places they don't think they
fit, so only goes to events they were explicitly invited to.
- The alien. Pleasantly isolated to such a degree that when
they casually talk about their normal life it reads as strange
and otherworldly to everyone else. Very odd and very
charming.
