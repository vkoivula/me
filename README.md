# About this site
You have reached my public internet profile and my repository-based social media.

I am starting my super slow migration into this digital repository. One day there might be something like the resume in BBS-based systems.

But unlike in BBS systems, I don't think it will be a social norm to list your personal computer and network hardware in your profile.

So instead of a list of hardware, there is a homepage of my cat [Surkia](Surkia.md) and [a Meme](MEME.md).

[Links](Links.md) you might find interesting.
